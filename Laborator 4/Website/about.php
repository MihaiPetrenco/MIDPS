				Welcome.<br /> <br />
				
				If you're reading this, then you probably downloaded
				<del>without permission</del> my repository. Welcome, I guess. <br /><br />
				Originally, this site was intended to be a quote database, where
				people could read and post quotes from movies, or from some famous
				people and all that stuff.<br /><br />
				But because I was bored, and had little time to play with all the
				HTML and CSS stuff, I decided to make a simple website with some
				pretty images and some text. <br /><br />
				Don't judge me.
